## Dev mode

Clone this repo, and start adding your code in the `index.ts` file.  
When you are done, write the tests in the `index.test.ts` file. For testing, this repo works with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

Once you finished, you can publish your module to npm with `npm publish`. This will compile your Typescript code
and send it to npm.

Make sure to change the name of the package in `package.json`
